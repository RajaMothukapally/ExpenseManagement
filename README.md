If Step 1 and 2 are properly configured, you will see Tomcat started on port(s): 8080. Now use the Postman collection mentioned at bottom to explore the APIs.

### Brief Introduction of APIs
There are  APIs for User and Entity,which contains login, registration,logout for User and CRUD for Expense entity.\
For first time user the user has to register using firstname,lastname,email and password.These inputs have validations.\
After registering the user has to login using the email and the password.\
CRUD operations for the user expenses involve
1. Creating new expense - http://localhost:8080/newexpense
2. User can reading the expense - http://localhost:8080/
3. User updating the expense - http://localhost:8080/editexpense/{id}
4. User deleting the expense - http://localhost:8080/delete/{id}

Entities are as follows
Expense (id, name,description,amount,category,date,createdat,updatedat,user)\
User (id,firstname,lastname,email,password)\
An intermediate entity known as student_courses is generated by JPARepository ORM which holds mapping of both tables.\

Future Plans
To create crud operations for User\
To Add roles like user_role and admin_role\
To add exceptions and error thymeleaf page
